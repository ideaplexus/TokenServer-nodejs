    This section shows you how to prepare, and run the sample application.
  sections:
    - title: Obtain an App ID
      content: |
        To build and run the sample application, get an App ID:
        1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/).
        2. In the Dashboard that opens, click **Projects** > **Project List** in the left navigation.
        3. Copy the **App ID** from the Dashboard.
    - title: Install dependencies and integrate the Agora Video SDK
      content: |
        1. Using the Terminal app, enter the `install` command in your project directory. This command installs libraries that are required to run the sample application.
            ``` bash
            # install dependencies
            npm install
            ```
        2. Start the application by entering the `run dev` or `run build` command.
            The `run dev` command is for development purposes.
            ``` bash
            # serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
            npm run dev
            ```
            The `run build` command is for production purposes and minifies code.
            ``` bash
            # build for production with minification
            npm run build
            ```
        3. Your default browser should open and display the sample application, as shown here.
            **Note:** In some cases, you may need to open a browser and enter `http://localhost:8080` as the URL.
